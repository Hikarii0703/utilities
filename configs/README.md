This is where I save some general config files.<br>
* .vimrc: for configuring files, requires vim-plug<br>
* .zshrc: I use Oh My Zsh instead of Bash, with Powerlevel10k (requires MesloLGS NF font)<br>
* cpp.json: contains snippets for VSCode for competitive programming in C++<br>
* settings.json: contains general configs for VSCode
